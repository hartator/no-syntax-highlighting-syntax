# No syntax highlighting theme

Disable Atom.io syntax highlighting.

Will still highlight code comments in a different color - clean blue - without making them less noticeable. Compared to just switching to "Plain Text", every Atom.io language-related features will be also still working. Including language completions, language snippets, language closure/bloc detections, auto-indent, etc.

Inspired by some articles stating that disabling syntax highlighting is actually a good thing. It should lower distractions and allow more focus on the meaning of the code. I wanted to try this in Atom.io.

Or, inside Atom's settings select Install and then search for this theme.
