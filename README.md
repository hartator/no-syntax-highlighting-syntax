# No syntax highlighting theme

Disable Atom.io syntax highlighting.

Will still highlight comments in a different color - clean blue - without making them less noticeable.

Compared to just switching to "Plain Text", every Atom.io language-related features will be still working. Including language completions, language snippets, language closure/bloc detections, auto-indent, etc.
